# Project guide for AI agents

Static site (vanilla JS, no framework/modules). Frontend code lives in `js/`,
styles in `css/`, Jest tests in `tests/js/` (jest-environment-jsdom 30).

Tooling is **npm**-based: `package-lock.json` is authoritative and `make`/CI run via
`npx`. A `pnpm-lock.yaml` also exists but is secondary — it drifts from `package.json`
(dependency bumps update only `package-lock.json`) and is regenerated out-of-band by
Jules/bolt branches. Expect large-but-benign `pnpm-lock.yaml` diffs when shipping those;
confirm it matches `package.json` rather than assuming a regression.

## Verify before committing

- `make precommit-fix` — auto-fixes formatting/lint and runs the full Jest suite + coverage. Run this before every commit; it must exit 0.
- `make check` — format-check + lint only (no tests). `make fix` — format + lint-fix.
- `make test` — full Jest suite + coverage table on demand (same report as `npm test`).
- `npx jest <path>` — run a single suite while iterating.
- Do not commit unless explicitly asked.

## Writing/debugging Jest tests

Read `docs/testing-notes.md` first — dated jsdom/jest gotchas specific to this repo,
and add an entry when you hit a new one. The two that bite most: `window.location`,
`window.document`, and `location.href` are **non-configurable** under jsdom 26
(`delete`/`Object.defineProperty` throw) — mock via `history.pushState`, a long
`location.hash`, or a `vm` context; and throwing **getters** on `window` are
silently bypassed — inject errors via function-value mocks or setters instead.

Before touching or adding a test in a large suite (e.g. `page-transition.test.js`,
100+ tests), `grep` the file for the function/branch name first. These suites often
already cover the path you're about to test, sometimes via a non-obvious pattern —
e.g. `loadInstrumentedScript()` in `page-transition.test.js` rewrites
`location.assign` calls to a mockable stub at load time instead of fighting jsdom's
non-configurable `Location`. Finding that pattern up front beats rediscovering it
after a few failed mocking attempts.

Scratch experiments: `npx jest` only discovers tests under the repo (a `/tmp`
path matches nothing), so probe jsdom behavior with a temp `tests/js/_*.test.js`
file — that prefix is gitignored, so it won't be committed or left in the suite.

## `.jules/` personas and `AGENTS.md`

`AGENTS.md` (repo root) is the shared operating contract for the Jules scheduled
routines — the non-negotiables, lanes, commit conventions, and command interface
they must follow. The `.jules/` directory holds one **persona definition** per
routine (`architect.md`, `bolt.md`, `janitor.md`, `palette.md`, `sentinel.md`,
`testpilot.md`): each routine's identity, lane, and constraints, which it reads in
at the start of a run.

These are **human-maintained definitions, not auto-recorded logs.** We edit them
to tune a routine's behaviour; the routines themselves must never write to
`.jules/` (a routine PR that touches it is out of scope — `AGENTS.md` says so).
Keep our own working learnings in `docs/`, not in a persona file. `.jules/` is
excluded from our Prettier and markdownlint gates (`.prettierignore`,
`.markdownlintignore`), so a format/lint failure in a `.jules/` file is expected —
don't "fix" it by reformatting. `AGENTS.md` itself **is** gated, so keep it
Prettier/markdownlint-clean (mind `**`-glob/bold collisions inside backticks).

Jules PRs occasionally commit **root-level scratch scripts** (e.g. `patch_*.js`,
`run_*.sh`) that it used to mutate test files in place. These fail eslint
(`require`/`no-undef` under the browser config) and break CI. When shipping a
Jules PR, drop them and keep only the genuine artifact (e.g. the new test file).

## Agent commands

Slash/custom commands are tracked under `.claude/commands/` (Claude) and
`.gemini/commands/` (Gemini). The rest of `.claude/` is gitignored.
